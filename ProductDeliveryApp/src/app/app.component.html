<!-- without react outlet routing working but the content is not visible. Router-outlet in Angular works as a placeholder which is used to load the different components dynamically based on the activated component or current route state. Navigation can be done using router-outlet directive and the activated component will take place inside the router-outlet to load its content. To enable routing, we need to use router-outlet into our HTML template like this.
